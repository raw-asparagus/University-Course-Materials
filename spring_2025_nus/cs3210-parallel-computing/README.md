# CS3210 - Parallel Computing

### Course Description
The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the field of parallel
computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel
machines. The course is divided into four parts: parallel computation models and
parallelism, parallel architectures, parallel algorithm design and programming,
and new parallel computing models. Topics includes: theory of parallelism and
models; shared-memory architectures; distributed-memory architectures; data
parallel architectures; interconnection networks, topologies and basic of
communication operations; principles of parallel algorithm design; performance
and scalability of parallel programs, overview of new parallel computing models
such as grid, cloud, GPGPU.
