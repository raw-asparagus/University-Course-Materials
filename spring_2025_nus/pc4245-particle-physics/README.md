# PC4245 - Particle Physics

### Course Description
This is an introductory course on the fundamental constituents of matter and
their basic interactions; important concepts and principles, recent important
experiments, underlying theoretical tools and calculation techniques in
elementary particles physics will be expounded. The topics covered are: basic
properties of elementary particles and the standard model, relativistic
kinematics; symmetries: isospin and SU(3), quark model; parity and CP violation;
Feynman diagrams and rules; quantum electrodynamics; cross sections and
lifetimes: deep inelastic scattering; and introductory gauge theories and
unified models. This course is mainly targeted at physics majors.
