# PC3261 - Classical Mechanics II

### Course Description
This elective course assumes knowledge of and is a sequel to PC2032. A good
command of calculus and linear algebra is desirable. It is intended for students
who wish to acquire a deeper understanding of our Mechanical Universe. It
considers the principles of relativistic, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics,
and aims to establish a bridge to the principles of modern Physics. Topics
covered include: dynamics with central forces, bound and unbound orbits,
scattering; relativistic kinematics and dynamics of a particle, Lorentz
transformations, four-dimensional notations; Lagrangian mechanics, the action
principle, Euler-Lagrange equation; Hamiltonian mechanics.
