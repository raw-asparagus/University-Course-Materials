# PC5252 - Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning

### Course Description
In the age of big scientific data, Bayesian statistical methods and machine
learning techniques are becoming a vital part of the modern scientist's toolkit.
This course provides a graduate level introduction to the two related fields,
with equal emphasis on both. Key topics for the first part include: fundamentals
of probability and inference, hierarchical modelling, model validation and
comparison, and Monte Carlo methods; for the second part, they include:
classification and regression, kernel methods, variational methods, and neural
networks. The course will be largely theoretically oriented, with the occasional
computational component.
