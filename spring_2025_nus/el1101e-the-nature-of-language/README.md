# EL1101E - The Nature of Language

### Course Description
This introductory overview of linguistics aims at equipping students with a
solid foundation in the object, methods and goals of the science of spoken
language, the prime tool of human communication. Through a principled analysis
of patterns of sound, form and meaning at the levels of word, sentence and text,
students will gain insight into what it means to say that language is a
rule-governed system and an organic whole. The results of this exploration will
be useful to those interested in the relationship between language and mind,
society and culture.
